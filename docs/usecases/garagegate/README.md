# Use case: Automatic Garage Gate
Academic example

## Goal
The goal of this use case is to provide a practical example of an embedded AI and vision example, implemented on a microcontroller with embedded camera. The case involved the detection of a car or not a car. The detection of a car triggers a motor that opens a garage gate. This use case uses the same principles and resources as the STEM workshop and embedded vision workshop, but implemented on an actual low power and low resources microcontroller, such as the ESP-EYE.

For more information, we refer to the information of both workshops ([Embedded Vision](workshops/embeddedvision), [STEM](workshops/stem))or contact us using the information below.
