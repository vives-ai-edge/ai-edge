## Introduction

introduction & practicalities, administrative business of the project

finalisation of UG via rule of order document
administrative updates and an overview of the workplan and progress of the milestones and workpackages etc

Overview of the final user group members

Because Piet Cordemans has been absent for a period over newyear, Jonas Lannoo took over the project coordination until the end of the project.
We have a new member of the usergroup, The LarbitsSisters who have a Larbitslab, an artist duo who makes art with and about technology.
We have developed two types of workshops, two levels of difficulty.
One which has an introduction to DL and uses minimal programming and the online tool Edge Impulse to train and  create AI models and put them on an embedded device.
Finally, I want to mention we got an extension of the project during the covid pandemic so the end of the project is scheduled for next month, end of may

now the workplan which was proposed in the project document. four workpackages wchich consist of subpackages. as you can see I used progress bars to indicate the progress of each step and also the progress of the milestones that comes with that workpackage. 
6 industrial case studies
unfinished things: planned to finish by end of may or end of august

## Discussion

* Luc Buydens (Melexis): Question about GDPR, how to continue with the issue about capturing people with a camera. How to continue that we want to use this data on our own company microcontroller, problem with the GDPR. We are bounded to it and the question triggers other actions. Nevertheless, result is very nice. Proof of concept is ok.
* Kris Bellemans (E.D.&A.): question to Sille, possible future work for use case, deploy the AI model on cortex M0? Can it be done by the end symposium?
  * Yes, it is using the mbed framework, so can be easily switched from target.
* Jonas Lannoo (VIVES): How did TML tackle the GDPR problem?
  * Peter Papics (TML): They used data from students some years ago, when gdpr rules were not active yet
* Toon Goedemé (KU Leuven): New project, automatically blurs faces to solve this issue.
