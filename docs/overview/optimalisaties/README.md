# Overview of the optimalisation techniques

During this project two specific optimalisation techniques were investigated. On the one hand quantisation, on the other hand pruning. Next to these two optimalisation techniques there are other ways to improve and accelerate your Deep Learning model when running it on an edge device. These methods are explained further.

## Quantisation

## Pruning

## Other optimalisation techniques

Next to quantisation and pruning there are othwer ways to optimise the running speed of the model. One could be by optimising the compiler settings, use a co-processor if the target has one or go to another type of device architecture.

### Compiler specific settings



### Availability of a co-processor



### Edge Device specific
